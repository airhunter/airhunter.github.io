这几个星期和美女处得似乎是越来越好，感觉气氛正在朝着情侣的方向发展，眼看着就快要离开“关系模糊”的状态了，至少截止到周未为止还是如此。
到了这周心情大好，自然精神也不错。不过可惜，好情况似乎也没保持多久，现在一下子变得又模糊起来。今天已经周三了，还没见到一次美女，貌似美女又回到了过去那种每晚都有活动的状态中去了。无语了……美女到是挺能适应这种变来变去的状况。不过我就适应不过来了，现在晚上无聊得没事干，不然也就不会在这里更新BLOG了。希望这些胸闷的日子赶快过去，我不想频繁更新BLOG。
得，继续推荐音乐吧，想想……思考……心情不好，推荐个悠郁的歌。Xandria的Eversleeping。

《Eversleeping》
——Xandria

****Once I travelled 7 seas to find my love
And once I sang 700 songs
Well, maybe I still have to walk 7000 miles
Until I find the one that I belong

I will rest my head side by side
To the one that stays in the night
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow
And whatever comes will come soon
Dying I will pray to the moon
That there once will be a better tomorrow

Once I crossed 7 rivers to find my love
And once, for 7 years, I forgot my name
Well, if I have to I will die 7 deaths just to lie
In the arms of my eversleeping aim

I will rest my head side by side
To the one that stays in the night
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow
And whatever comes will come soon
Dying I will pray to the moon
That there once will be a better tomorrow (x2)

I dreamt last night that he came to me
He said: "My love, why do you cry?"
For now it won't be long any more
Until in my cold grave we will lie
Until in my cold grave we will lie
